        "Title":"Software Engineering",
        "Discription": "A software engineer analyzes the problem statement and designs a scalable solution using software engineering principles. They are also responsible for data designing, acquiring, maintenance and security, test case designing and documentation. A software engineer also communicates with all the stakeholders at every step of the software development process and may also double up as the product manager with the right experience.A software engineering job description should inform the potential candidates about your company and its culture, products they will be working on, their work profile and general expectations. For clarity, you can discuss all this under different headings such as a job brief, responsibilities, skills and qualifications, equal employment opportunities statement, benefits, and company culture"

        "Discription": "Information technology (IT) is the use of computers, storage, networking and other physical devices, infrastructure and processes to create, process, store, secure and exchange all forms of electronic data. Typically, IT is used in the context of business operations, as opposed to the technology used for personal or entertainment purposes. The commercial use of IT encompasses both computer technology and telecommunications.Harvard Business Review coined the term information technology in 1958 to distinguish between purpose-built machines designed to perform a limited scope of functions and general-purpose computing machines that could be programmed for various tasks. As the IT industry evolved from the mid-20th century, computing capability increased, while device cost and energy consumption decreased, a cycle that continues today when new technologies emerge"

        "Title":"Electricial Engineering",
        "Discription": "Electrical and electronics engineers work in industries including research and development, engineering services, manufacturing, telecommunications, and the federal government. Electrical and electronics engineers generally work indoors in offices. However, they may have to visit sites to observe a problem or a piece of complex equipment.Electrical and electronics engineers must have a bachelorâ€™s degree. Employers also value practical experience, such as internships or participation in cooperative engineering programs."
